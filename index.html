                            Marc Chagall was born in Viciebsk on 6 July 1887 in the family of a small merchant Khatskel
                            (Zakhar) Chagall and was the eldest of nine children. Years later, the master himself always
                            celebrated his birthday on 7 July.
                        </p>

                            At the age of 19, with the blessing of Feiga-Ita's mother, Mark entered the school of the
                            famous
                            Viciebsk painter Yudel Pan, who recognised a bright talent and offered the young man to
                            study
                            for
                            free. A few months later, the future artist left to study in St. Petersburg.

                        <p class="paragraph">
                            For several years, the young Chagall studied at the Drawing School of the Society for the
                            Encouragement of Arts under the guidance of Nicholas Roerich, then - at the public school of
                            Elena Zvantseva, where his mentors were the famous Leon Bakst and Mstislav Dobuzhinsky.

                            In 1910 Chagall continued his studies in Paris: he attended classes at free academies of
                            arts,
                            visited all kinds of exhibitions and galleries, learnt new trends in art - Cubism, Futurism,
                            Orphism... And at the same time created his own style, not similar to others

                            In June 1914, the first exhibition of Marc Chagall was held in Berlin, which brought
                            together
                            almost all the paintings and drawings he had made in Paris. After its success, many people
                            became aware of Chagall.

                            Commissioner of Fine Arts, he believed he could change mentalities through artistic
                            practices.
                            But
                            his contribution by the first anniversary of the Revolution was misinterpreted by the new
                            authorities and teachers he brought from Saint-Petersburg and Moscow to his school, and
                            Malevitch,
                            Lissitzky, Pougny and others – all Suprematists – took a stand against him, forcing him out.

                            now
                            acknowledged to be the masterpiece of his youth. Despite his material struggles, this was an
                            intensely prolific period for the artist: in his paintings (Promenade, 1917-18, State
                            Russian

                            personal
                            vision blending fantasy and the fantastic with borrowings from Futurism, Cubism and
                            Suprematism.

                            In 1922, Chagall moved with his family, first to Lithuania (his exhibition was held in
                            Kaunas),
                            and
                            then to Berlin. It was here that he produced his first engravings, for 'Ma vie', his poetic

                            Vollard, who commissioned illustrated engravings from him for Gogol’s Dead Souls and then La

                            He travelled around France with his family, depicting its landscapes in drawings and a wide

                            By the 1930s, his artistic influence began to hark more from Impressionism and the ambient

                            In 1931, he was invited to Palestine by the Mayor of Tel Aviv with a view to founding a

                            Art Museum. On his return, he created 40 gouache paintings to illustrate the Bible in

                            In 1935, after a trip to Poland where he got the full measure of anti-Semite sentiment, he

                            branded a “degenerate artist” by the Nazis.

                            In 1937, he at last became a French national with the support of Jean Paulhan.
                            He was a frequent visitor to the Maritain Salon and rubbed shoulders with the writers

                            Delteil, Soupault, Cocteau, Reverdy and Arland whose work he illustrated.
                            When war broke out, he took refuge in Gordes, in the free zone, but was ultimately left with
                            no
                            choice but to leave Occupied France in 1941.

                            However, on September 2, 1944, Bella died of sepsis in a local hospital. Nine months later,

                                    Nostalgia for the artist's rustic village is at the heart of this painting.

                                    rooftops were a popular motif of Chagall's, stemming from his memories of

                                    and
                                    the Belarusian countryside he called home as a child. This motif also reflects

                                    artist's deep devotion to his Jewish cultural roots. In Green Violinist, his
                                    subject
                                    (who may represent the prophet Elijah) is an extension of the rooftops,

                                    the
                                    windows and geometric shapes in his pant legs; he is literally a colorful man, a

                                    of the community, poised in rhythmic stance. Chagall also recalls with this

                                    the
                                    belief among the Chabad Hasidim in Viciebsk that music and dance represented a

                                    with God.

                                    ‘theater of memory’.
                                    “For me a circus is a magic show that appears and disappears like a world. A
                                    circus
                                    is
                                    disturbing. It is profound. These clowns, bareback riders and acrobats have made
                                    themselves at home in my visions. Why? Why am I so touched by their make-up and
                                    their
                                    grimaces? With them I can move toward new horizons. Lured by their colors and

                                    can dream of painting new psychic distortions,” explained Chagall.

                                    The theme of loving couples was something that Chagall had explored in his
                                    earlier
                                    work
                                    (see The Birthday and The Promenade) and he revisits this to reveal the
                                    importance
                                    of
                                    memory to him at this stage of his career. The painting portrays an entrancing
                                    vision of
                                    a world of ecstatic dream and romance; an approach which is typically Chagall.
